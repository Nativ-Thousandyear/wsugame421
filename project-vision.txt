587 Project Vision Statement: "Fire and Ice Frontline"

1. Game Overview
"Fire and Ice Frontline" is a fast-paced top-down shooter game designed in MonoGame. The game is a thrilling, short-duration experience over four distinct phases.
The player controls a hero character, navigating through waves of enemies and battling bosses with increasing difficulty.

2. Gameplay Duration and Phases

Total Duration: Approximately 2-3 minutes.
Phase 1: Regular play with grunt enemies (45 seconds).
Phase 2: Mid-boss attack (30 seconds).
Phase 3: Additional grunt enemies (45 seconds).
Phase 4: Final boss attack with two stages (60 seconds).

3. Enemy Types

Grunt Enemies: Standard foes with basic attack patterns.
Mid-Boss: A stronger enemy with more elaborate attacks.
